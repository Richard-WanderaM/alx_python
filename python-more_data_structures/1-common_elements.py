 # Calculate the intersection of the two sets and return the result

def common_elements(set_1, set_2):

    return set_1.intersection(set_2)

# We create the common_elements function by using the intersection operation between the two sets.
# This operation returns a new set that contains elements that are common to both sets.
    

#QUESTION
# Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
